X-NUCLEO-S2868A1: S2LP radio shield
###################################

Overview
********
The X-NUCLEO-S2868A1 expansion board is based on the S2-LP radio and operates
in the 868 MHz ISM frequency band. The expansion board is compatible with ST
morpho and Arduino UNO R3 connectors. The X-NUCLEO-S2868A1 interfaces with
the STM32 Nucleo microcontroller via SPI connections and GPIO pins. You can
change some of the GPIOs by mounting or removing the resistors.
